                  As a young trumpet player I faced many obstacles in my playing due to poorly established habits and an
                  unsuitable embouchure. I loved being a band kid, but no matter how long I practiced I struggled to
                  perform. This continued into the first year of my undergraduate degree.
                <p class="lead">

                  At the end of my first year I
                  made the leap to change my embouchure and establish new habits that would serve me better in my
                  pursuit as a trumpet player. The subsequent months after the change were difficult, but through slow,
                  thoughtful practice I relearned how to play, this time with appreciably better habits and less
                  tension. My experience has given me a unique insight and passion for helping other trumpet players
                  avoid the same mistakes I made.

                  more active on social media and use it as a platform to showcase the music I’m currently learning, or
                  groups I’m performing with.
