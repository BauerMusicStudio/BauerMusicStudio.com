                  My name is Randy Bauer, I'm an Idaho native born and raised in Caldwell. At 11 years old I started
                  learning to play the trumpet; I've now been playing the trumpet for 15 years. My experience as a young
                  trumpet player was difficult because my embouchure and fundementals were poorly established. No matter
                  how many hours I practiced, I played with pain in my embourchure and struggled to perform. Despite
                  these challenges I persevered and underwent an embouchure change my first year of college.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                  Through my experiences as a Trumpet Performance Major at Boise State University I corrected my
                  embouchure and sharpened my fundementals. While I changed how I played, I discovered that I wanted to
                  help other trumpet players develop proper technique so they wouldn't endure the same struggles I had
                  faced.
                  I will always be grateful for the journey I went through, from starting college re-learning how to
                  play trumpet, to winning the concerto aria with the BSU Orchestra my final year, and meeting my wife
                  Grace. When I'm not playing trumpet or teaching I enjoy working on cars, camping, and trying out new
                  recipes in the kitchen.
