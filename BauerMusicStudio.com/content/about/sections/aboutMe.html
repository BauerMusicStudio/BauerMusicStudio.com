                  My name is Randy Bauer, I'm an Idaho native. I've been honing my trumpet skills for over 15
                  years. My experience as a young trumpet player was difficult because my embouchure was poorly
                  established.Despite the
                  hours I practiced, I played with pain in my embouchure and struggled to perform. I persevered and
                  decided to change my
                  embouchure my first year of college.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">

                  As a Trumpet Performance Major at Boise State University I corrected my embouchure and sharpened my
                  fundamentals. I
                  also found my passion for helping other trumpet players develop proper technique to help them avoid
                  the same mistakes
                  I struggled through.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  When I'm not playing trumpet or teaching I enjoy working on cars, camping, and trying out new recipes
                  in the kitchen
                  with my wife.
